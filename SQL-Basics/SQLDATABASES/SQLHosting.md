# SQL Hosting
If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language.

If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.

The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.

## MS SQL Server
Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.

SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.

## Oracle
Oracle is also a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.

Oracle is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.

## MySQL
MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites.

MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.

MySQL is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.

## Access
When a web site requires only a simple database, Microsoft Access can be a solution.

Access is not well suited for very high-traffic, and not as powerful as MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.
